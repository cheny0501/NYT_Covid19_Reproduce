# NYT_Covid19
For better understanding of reproducible data science, a practice in the assignment with reproducing COVID-19 visulizations and tables published by the
the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html) was done by Chen Yang.

Raw data for cases for states and counties can be downloaded from this [NYT GitHub repository](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) (use us-counties.csv).

The tasks I attempted to reproduce the following for January 17th, 2021 are:
1. New cases as a function of time with a rolling average plot - the first plot on the page (you don't need to recreate the colors or theme)
2. Table of cases, hospitalizations and deaths - the first table on the page
3. The county-level map for previous week ('Hot spots') - the second plot on the page (only the 'Hot Spots' plot)
4. Table of cases by state - the second table on the page (do not need to include per 100,000 or per capita columns)

This project was submitted in the forms of RMarkdown file and corresponding compiled/knitted PDF, with commented code and text interspersed, 
including a brief critique of the reproducibility of each plot and table. This repository also include a README file describing the contents of the repository 
and how to reproduce all results. The license and gitignore are also included.
